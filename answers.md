1. Git is a version control system that tracks changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions if you ever need to.
 We need git to assist us in tracking the changes and updates so that we can see who made which changes. Git also provides when and why a change was made.
 
2. Github is a hosting site where developers and programmers can upload the code they create and  work collaboratively to improve it. The platform is built around Respitories used to
organize codes for single projects. Individuals use it to host small websites,organize projects and collaborate with community members.

3. The Git Commit command will save all staged changes, along with a brief description from the user, in a "commit" to the local repository. You can think of a commit as a snapshot 
of your project, where a new version is created in the repository. The commit command differs from saving a file because git does not add changes to a commit automatically. You need
to indicate which file and changes need to be saved before running the Git commit command.

4. The Git Add command allows you to add all the files inside your project folder to the staging area. When using the Git Add command
you would type (git add "the name of the file" OR ".")

5. The Git Push command is most commonly used to publish and upload local changes to a central repository. After a local repository has been modified a push command is executed 
to share the modifications with remote team members.

6. The Git Clone command is used to create a copy of an existing repository into a new directory.It is also used to create remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned
repository. I would use the git clone command when I'm finished making changes to my files and ready to push them to my remote repository (Github) so that it is easier for me to add or 
remove files,and to fix merge conflicts. Working on a local repository provides more flexibility to me.

7. A fork is a complete copy of a repository, including all files, commits, and (optionally) branches. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes 
without affecting the original project.

8. A branch is a way to keep developing and coding new features or modifications to the software and not affect the main branch of the repository.
 When creating a branch,define a source, usually the main folder and a target. 
Forking, on the other hand, is a cloning operation in Git that is executed on the entire repository level.Forking creates a full copy of the original 
repository without affecting the main repository and the copy sits in your account. In comparison, branching creates a branch that is attached to the main repository to encapsulate your changes.
